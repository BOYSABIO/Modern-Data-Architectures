Set up for your GITHUB

1. Open the Terminal
2. Generate an SSH Key:
    run the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "YOUR@EMAIL.com"
    a) Use the default file location "so just press enter and don't type anything"
    b) If it asks overwrite? just type y for yes
    c) If it asks for a passphrase, also just press enter and don't type anything
    d) Finally you should see a fingerprint displayed with a bunch of random stuff
3. Add the code to github
    run the command: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    a) You will see your SPECIAL KEY pasted in the terminal COPY IT
    b) Go into your GitHub -> Click on SETTINGS in top right -> Select SSH AND GPG KEYS -> NEW SSH KEY -> Give a random name, paste your SPECIAL KEY & save it
4. Check that it works
    run the command: ssh -T git@github.com
    a) It should say "HI you've successfully authenticated" if not, then try the whole thing again but make sure you copy everything correct
5. Set server to our Repository
    run the command: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:BOYSABIO/Modern-Data-Architectures.git
6. Now everything should be set up for GitHub!

One last thing:
For our project, you need to also run the following command to install a package that the code uses:
    run the command: sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg -y  # On Ubuntu/Debian
Now aside from the python libraries, everything should be set up
